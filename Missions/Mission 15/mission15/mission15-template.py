# NOTE: DO NOT remove the 2 lines of code below.

# In particular, you will need to modify the `your_AI = XX_AI` line so that
# `XX_AI` is the name of your AI class.
# For instance, if your AI class is called `MyPrecious_AI`, then you have to
# modify that line to:
#
#     your_AI = MyPrecious_AI
#
# Failure to do so will result in the following exception on Coursemology when
# you run the test cases:
#
#     Traceback (most recent call last):
#       in <module>
#     NameError: name 'your_AI' is not defined
